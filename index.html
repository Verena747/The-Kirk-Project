      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        The Kirk Project is dedicated to responsibly investigating and assessing potential threats of political violence, school-related violence, community violence, and targeted violence. 
        Every threat—no matter how small or seemingly insignificant—is reviewed to ensure public safety and prevent credible threats from escalating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many comments online are overlooked or dismissed as impulsive reactions or jokes. 
        Our mission is to take such statements seriously—not to police free speech, but to evaluate and understand risks properly to safeguard lives while respecting freedom of expression.
