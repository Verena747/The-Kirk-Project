          <h3>Prevent</h3>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Many incidents of violence show warning signs that were ignored or dismissed. The Kirk Project ensures that every concerning comment or action is responsibly reviewed — not censored, but understood — to protect both safety and liberty.

  <h2>Our Mission</h2>
  <p>
    The Kirk Project is dedicated to identifying and assessing threats of violence — whether political, school-related, or community-based — with responsibility and care.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our mission is to ensure that every warning, no matter how small or emotional, is reviewed thoughtfully and professionally. We believe in safeguarding free speech while preventing credible threats before they become tragedies. This is not about censorship — it’s about protection, understanding, and the duty to keep communities safe.
