      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        The Kirk Project is dedicated to the responsible assessment and prevention of potential threats of violence — political, school-related, community-based, or targeted. We believe that every concern, no matter how minor it appears, deserves professional evaluation to ensure public safety and prevent tragedy.

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Many violent acts stem from unaddressed warning signs — comments online, behavioral shifts, or impulsive statements dismissed as jokes. The Kirk Project takes these seriously, combining data, empathy, and threat assessment expertise to intervene before harm occurs.
