      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>
        The Kirk Project is a public-interest initiative committed to preventing acts of violence through responsible investigation and assessment of potential threats. We believe that credible prevention requires vigilance, compassion, and respect for free expression.

          <h3>Investigate</h3>
          <p>We evaluate potential threats — political, school-related, or community-based — using evidence-based analysis and open-source data.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Educate</h3>
          <p>We promote awareness about digital behavior, online discourse, and the difference between expression and credible threats.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="card">
          <h3>Prevent</h3>
          <p>By assessing early warning signs, we aim to stop violence before it occurs — protecting both individuals and the right to speak freely.</p>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Many incidents of violence show warning signs that were ignored or dismissed. The Kirk Project ensures that every concerning comment or action is responsibly reviewed — not censored, but understood — to protect both safety and liberty.
