      <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
      <p>
        The Kirk Project was founded on a single principle: that every potential act of violence deserves to be taken seriously — assessed with care, evidence, and integrity. We aim to bridge the gap between digital communication and real-world consequences, ensuring that credible threats are identified early and handled responsibly.

      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>
        We do not police speech or silence voices. Instead, we advocate for a balanced approach: protecting both the right to free expression and the right of communities to live without fear. Our framework focuses on behavioral analysis, open-source intelligence, and community partnerships to intervene before violence occurs.
