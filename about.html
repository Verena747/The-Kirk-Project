    <h2>About The Kirk Project</h2>
    <p style="font-size:1.1rem;line-height:1.7;">
      The Kirk Project was founded with a single mission: to prevent targeted violence before it happens.
      Every threat — no matter how small or seemingly harmless — is analyzed for credibility,
      intent, and risk potential.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size:1.1rem;line-height:1.7;">
      We partner with schools, law enforcement, community leaders, and digital platforms to build safer
      environments while respecting civil liberties and the right to free expression.

    <h2>About The Kirk Project</h2>
    <p>
      The Kirk Project was founded on a simple belief: that every potential threat deserves thoughtful attention before it becomes a tragedy. We exist to bridge the gap between freedom of expression and responsible threat assessment.
    </p>
    <p>
      By leveraging behavioral science, open-source intelligence, and interdisciplinary analysis, our team helps communities identify and de-escalate concerning behavior before violence occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not aim to police speech — our mission is to evaluate, understand, and prevent credible threats while respecting civil liberties. Every report is reviewed with discretion, neutrality, and professionalism.
