      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>
        The Kirk Project was founded on the belief that every community deserves to be safe — and that responsible assessment of potential threats can prevent violence before it occurs. 
        Too often, online statements that could signal danger are ignored or dismissed. Our initiative aims to change that, using structured, ethical, and evidence-based methods to evaluate risks without infringing on individual rights.

      <h2>Our Approach</h2>
      <p>
        We employ multidisciplinary strategies combining behavioral science, threat assessment models, and transparent review processes to identify credible concerns. 
        This ensures that every potential threat — political, educational, or community-related — receives proper consideration while preserving freedom of speech and privacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collaboration is central to our mission. We seek partnerships with schools, local authorities, digital platforms, and research institutions to promote shared responsibility in identifying and mitigating threats before harm occurs.
      </p>

      <h2>Ethics and Integrity</h2>
      <p>
        The Kirk Project upholds strict ethical standards in all investigations. We do not advocate censorship or punitive action for speech; rather, we emphasize context, intent, and proportional response. 
        Our guiding principle is that <strong>safety and liberty can coexist when handled with care and integrity.</strong>
