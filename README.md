# 🏛️ The Kirk Project

**The Kirk Project** is a public-interest initiative dedicated to responsibly investigating and assessing potential threats of political, school-related, community, and targeted violence. Our mission is to prevent credible threats while upholding free expression — ensuring every warning, no matter how small, is properly reviewed for public safety.

## 🌐 Mission Statement

In an era of instant communication and viral content, threats are often dismissed as jokes or emotional reactions. The Kirk Project exists to ensure that no potential warning is overlooked, using evidence-based assessments to distinguish credible threats from harmless speech — promoting safety without sacrificing liberty.
